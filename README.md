# ANLY512 Final Project Group18

## Analysis for Diabetes 

### Group 18 - Yutao Chen, Ziyue Li, Yichen Liu, Shenghao Wang

#### Data:

Datasets are from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset.

#### Models:

Logistic regression, Random forest by using R language.

To implement deep learning techniques, including MLP and CNN, implemented by Pytorch. To effectively analyze the relationships between factors, we employed GNNs to model complex interactions between variables. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into diabetes risk factors, relationships, and prediction performance, contributing to improved prevention and management strategies.

#### Images:

In this part, images are including MLP, CNN and GNN network structures and these three deep learning models' loss plot.

#### EDA:

EDA folder includes correlation coefficient matrix about all variables, and all violin plots between "Diabetes_binary" and all variables
