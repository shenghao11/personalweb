## Analysis for Diabetes 

#### Data:

Datasets are from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset.

#### Models:

First, we applied logistic regression and random forest models in R to determine the main factors affecting diabetes. We  explored various factors that best predict diabetes. Additionally, these models allowed us to investigate the relationships between the factors and their potential impact on the target variable.

Next, to implement deep learning techniques, including MLP and CNN, implemented by Pytorch. To effectively analyze the relationships between factors, we employed GNNs to model complex interactions between variables. This comprehensive approach provides valuable insights into diabetes risk factors, relationships, and prediction performance, contributing to improved prevention and management strategies.

#### Images:

In this part, images are including MLP, CNN and GNN network structures and these three deep learning models' loss plot.
